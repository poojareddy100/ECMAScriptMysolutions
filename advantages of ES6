1. It adds new features of variables called let and const.
2. Adding const infornt of an array makes an array it as a constant that means one cannot reassign a new array to older array bu its mutable
3. Adding const infornt of an object makes it the same way but you can make it immutable by adding a Object.fixed(objName).
4. one can use arrow functions which reduce the length of the functions which are not used again
5. we can also set default parameters if one forgets or doesn't want to share the parameter the function uses or prints default parameter given to it. I mean to say default 
parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified.
6. One can use rest parameter with function parameters
